- implement edition of composite transactions

- validate HTML & CSS

- speed up tests

- allow templates to be created (useful for recurring transactions). A
  template could be a pickled form.

- expand documentation and publish on packages.python.org and PyPI.

- make CSRF errors visible. Currently, the form is redisplayed (just
  like for any kind of error), but because the 'csrf_token' field is
  hidden, so is the error message.
