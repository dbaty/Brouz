- store amounts in eurocents

- add a field to store VAT that can be deducted (if any)

- add a checkbox for "meals" ("frais de bouche") : if checked, only a
  part of it is taken in account

  2013 : max = 17,70 TTC
         base = 4,55 TTC

  => deductible = max(min(year_max, amount) - base, 0)

- use the same values for CATEGORY_* constants as those defined by
  AGAO (are they standard or specific to AGAO?)

- speed up tests

- allow templates to be created (useful for recurring transactions). A
  template could be a pickled form.

- expand documentation and publish on packages.python.org and PyPI.

- make CSRF errors visible. Currently, the form is redisplayed (just
  like for any kind of error), but because the 'csrf_token' field is
  hidden, so is the error message.
